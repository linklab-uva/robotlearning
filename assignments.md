- We require you to use _LaTeX_ for your homeworks and reports in this course.

- If you are not familiar with Latex, useful links and resources have been included under the [Materials](https://linklab-uva.github.io/robotlearning/materials/) page.

### Late Submission Policy
- Each student will have 8 “late days” to use during the semester which can be used to submit the deliverables later than they are due.
- Deliverables that are submitted late after exhausting this quota will result in 50% credit deduction per day.
