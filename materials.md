# Additional Reading Material
The following books contain some advanced material. You can use it for your own reference and to brush up fundamentals of machine learning and optimization.
1. “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” by Christopher Bishop. [PDF](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf){:target="_blank"}
2. “An Invitation to 3-D Vision: From Images to Models“ by Yi Ma, Stefano Soatto, Jana Kosecka, Shankar Sastry. [PDF](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cer/arv/readings/old_mkss.pdf){:target="_blank"}
3. “Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control” by Dmitri Bertsekas. [Material](https://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/RLbook.html){:target="_blank"}
4. “Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers” by Karl Johan Astrom and Richard M. Murray, [PDF](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/am08-complete_28Sep12.pdf){:target="_blank"}
5. (Advanced) “Linear Systems Theory” by João P. Hespanha. [Website](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~hespanha/linearsystems/){:target="_blank"}
6. (Fairly advanced) “Stochastic Models, Information Theory, and Lie Groups, Volume 1: Classical Results and Geometric Methods” by Gregory Chirikjian. [PDF](http://entsphere.com/pub/pdf/2000%20Chirikjian,%20Stochastic%20Models,%20Information%20Theory,%20and%20Lie%20Groups.pdf){:target="_blank"}

# Computational Resources
Almost all coursework can be done using your laptop. We will use PyTorch [https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org){:target="_blank"} and MuJoCo [http://www.mujoco.org](http://www.mujoco.org){:target="_blank"} in the later parts of the course for reinforcement learning. If you want additional computational resources, you can take a look at the following.
Free: Google Colab [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com){:target="_blank"} is a very good platform with a good GPU that you can use for most small-scale experiments. Gradient [https://gradient.paperspace.com](https://gradient.paperspace.com){:target="_blank"} is another free tool with more generous compute resources (6-hour timeouts and persistent sessions). If you haven’t used it already Google Cloud Project gives $300 of starter credits [https://cloud.google.com/free](https://cloud.google.com/free){:target="_blank"}.
Paid: You can also sign up for Google Colab Pro [https://colab.research.google.com/signup](https://colab.research.google.com/signup){:target="_blank"} for a very reasonable $10/month to get access to faster GPUs and less restrictive preemption of jobs.

# Use _Latex_ !

- We require you to use LaTeX for your reports in this course, as LaTeX is a skill you should learn if you haven’t already!
- We will provide you with the templates to structure your submissions.
- Additionally,

# Issac Asimov

A PDF copy of the book I-Robot (1950) - which contains the short story _Liar_ (originally published in 1941), within which the term _Robot_ was coined. [PDF](/docs/asimov.pdf){:target="_blank"}
