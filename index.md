## Prerequisites Required
- Proficiency in programming (<list CS courses here>). All assignments will be based on Python but if you have used a similar language like MATLAB before, you should be able to pick up Python easily. Recitation sessions will provide preparatory material.
- Probability ( (<list preq course here>))
- Linear Algebra (<list preq course here>)

## Recommended
- Machine Learning or Data Analysis (<list preq course here>)
- (Soft recommendation) Optimization (<list preq course here>)

## Evaluation
- 4 homeworks (60% in total)
- Mid-term exam (20%)
- Final project (teams of 3) (15%)
- You will write a summary (it can be as elaborate as you like but at least 2 pages) that demonstrates your understanding of the material in your own words for each of the modules in the course. These summaries will together make up for 5% of your final grade. There is no partial credit here, depending on the quality of your summary, you either get all the 5% or none.
